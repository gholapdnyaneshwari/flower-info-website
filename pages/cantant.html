        </u>
        <p>A sunflower is a tall, bright yellow flowering plant known for its large, round flower head that resembles
            the sun. It belongs to the genus Helianthus and is famous for turning its face toward the sun, a behavior
            called heliotropism. Sunflowers are grown for their beauty, edible seeds, and oil, which is widely used in
            cooking and industry. They symbolize happiness, loyalty, and positivity.</p>
